# bearbeer 🧸🍻

It's a minimal boilerplate blogging engine for programmers written in [OCaml 🐫]. It is designed to be lean, mean, and hackable for self-hosting purposes.
Was inspired by [deno_blog 🦕] and [Bear Blog 🐻] projects.
Default CSS styles credits by [rokcso/hugo-bearneo].

If you want to add something, just [fork it](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and go drink beer 🍻.

## Installation

Installation latest development version via the [OPAM package manager](https://opam.ocaml.org). Prebuilt binaries are not available yet.

<!-- **Features**

- Opinionated style and project organization are done and done well
- Dead simple to use and configure with the help of lovely documentation
- Self-hosted and self-managed web server, or a static bundle
- Single static binary for easy deployment and packaging of your system
- And, yeah, it's written in OCaml, which must be the reason why. -->
