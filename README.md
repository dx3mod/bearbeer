# bearbeer

It's a minimal boilerplate blogging engine for programmers written in [OCaml]. It is designed to be lean, mean, and hackable for self-hosting purposes.
Was inspired by [deno_blog] and [Bear Blog] projects.

If you want to add something, just fork it and go drink beer.

## Installation

Now you can get only upstream (developer branch) version using OPAM, building
from sources:

```
$ opam pin bearbeer.dev https://github.com/dx3mod/bearbeer.git
```

## Motivation

Why not use a production-ready static site generator instead of writing another flimsy blogging engine?

I appreciate opinionated solutions, be it a formatter, a build system or anything else. They just have everything done and done right. Because I wrote a hackable blogging engine for true enthusiasts who are ready to explore and improve the programs they use.

## Quick Start

In progress...
